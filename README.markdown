#CppKoans

Inspired by [RubyKoans](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) and 
[JavaScript-Koans](https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans), this is an attemt to write 
such koans for C/C++.

Some ideas were taken from [PointerKoans](https://github.com/paytonrules/PointerKoan).

###Prerequesites
You will need [CMake](http://cmake.org/).

And of course a C++ compiler.
I just tested it with a recent GCC.

##How to walk the path to enlightment
1. Get the sources

        git clone git://github.com/torbjoernk/CppKoans.git

2. Create a build directory

        cd CppKoans
        mkdir build
        cd build

3. Configure the build

        cmake ..

4. Compile

        make

5. Run

        ./CppKoans


Now follow the instructions printed from the very beginning.

The files, you will need to edit are in `CppKoans/koans`.
Each time you saved a file and want to rerun the koans, you need to compile it first.
Thus, walking the path to enlightment is a repetition of these steps:

1. Edit and save a file in `CppKoans/koans`

2. Compile in `CppKoans/build` by running `make`

3. Read the master's reply with `./CppKoans/build/CppKoans`
